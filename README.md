# Inflationary Cosmology

This repository contains my independent theoretical study of inflationary cosmology, combining a modern field-theoretic treatment with conceptual foundations from cosmology.

The main reference is Daniel Baumann’s *Cosmology*, where I study:
- The horizon problem and the motivation for inflation  
- Shrinking comoving Hubble radius and causal structure  
- Scalar-field–driven inflation  
- Slow-roll conditions and dynamics  
- Physical interpretation of inflationary expansion through analytical derivations  

In parallel, I use Leonard Susskind’s *The Theoretical Minimum: Cosmology* to build intuition and big-picture understanding, including:
- The standard cosmological model and expansion of the universe  
- Hubble’s law and cosmic redshift  
- The cosmic microwave background and early-universe physics  
- Dark matter, dark energy, and the role of vacuum energy  
- How inflation fits naturally into the history of the universe  

This project aims to bridge mathematical formalism with physical intuition, developing a clear understanding of why inflation is needed, how it works, and how it connects to observational cosmology.

The repository serves as a structured record of derivations, notes, and conceptual insights developed during my study of early-universe cosmology.# Inflationary-Cosmology
A theoretical study of inflationary cosmology based on Daniel Baumann’s *Cosmology*, exploring the horizon problem, shrinking comoving Hubble radius, scalar-field–driven inflation, and slow-roll dynamics through analytical derivations and physical interpretation.
